    a Sit With Me account or use Sit With Me, you agree to these terms.</p>
  <p><b>ARBITRATION NOTICE: YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION
  AND

  <p>In return for our commitment to provide the Service, we require you to make the below commitments to us.</p>

  <p><strong>Who Can Use Sit With Me.</strong> We want our Service to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also
    want it to be safe,

  <p><strong>How You Can't Use Sit With Me.</strong> Providing a safe and open Service for a broad community requires that
    we all do our part.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You can't impersonate others or provide inaccurate information.</strong></p>
      <p>You don't have to disclose your identity on Sit with Me, but you must provide us with accurate and up to date

    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You can't violate (or help or encourage others to violate) these Terms or our policies, including in

          Community Guidelines.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You can't do anything to interfere with or impair the intended operation of the Service.</strong></p>
      <p>This includes misusing any reporting, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent or groundless

        appeals.</p>
    </li>
    <li>

        or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Sit With Me usernames, passwords, or
        misappropriate access tokens.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You can't post someone else’s private or confidential information without permission or do anything that
          violates
          someone else's rights, including intellectual property rights (e.g., copyright infringement, trademark
          infringement,
          counterfeit, or pirated goods).</strong></p>
      <p>You may use someone else's works under exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights under applicable
        law.
        You represent you own or have obtained all necessary rights to the content you post or share.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You can’t modify, translate, create derivative works of, or reverse engineer our products or their
          components.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You can't use a domain name or URL in your username without our prior written consent.</strong></p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Permissions You Give to Us.</strong> As part of our agreement, you also give us permissions that we need to
    provide the Service.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>We do not claim ownership of your content, but you grant us a license to use it.</strong></p>
      <p>Nothing is changing about your rights in your content. We do not claim ownership of your content that you post on
        or
        through the Service and you are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want. However, we need
        certain
        legal permissions from you (known as a “license”) to provide the Service. When you share, post, or upload content
        that
        is covered by intellectual property rights (like photos or videos) on or in connection with our Service, you
        hereby
        grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to host, use,
        distribute,
        modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent
        with
        your privacy and application settings). This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems. You
        can
        delete content individually or all at once by deleting your account.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Permission to use your username, profile picture, and information about your relationships and actions
          with accounts,
          ads, and sponsored content.</strong></p>
      <p>You give us permission to show your username, profile picture, and information about your actions (such as likes
        and
        location) or relationships (such as follows) next to or in connection with accounts, ads, offers, and other
        sponsored
        content that you follow or engage with, without any compensation to you. For example, we may show that you liked a
        sponsored post created by a brand that has paid us to display its ads. As with actions on other content and
        follows of
        other accounts, actions on sponsored content and follows of sponsored accounts can be seen only by people who have
        permission to see that content or follow. We will also respect your ad settings.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You agree that we can download and install updates to the Service on your device.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Permission to display your location and work hours.</strong></p>
      <p>As you are aware, the Service can be set to provide your location and work hours to the general public, depending
        on
        your privacy settings. You expressly agree that to the extent your location or work schedule information is set to
        public, the Service can display such information publicly. You further agree to hold the company harmless for
        displaying
        such information publicly.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Additional Rights We Retain</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If you select a username or similar identifier for your account, we may change it if we believe it is appropriate
        or
        necessary (for example, if it infringes someone's intellectual property or impersonates another user).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Service (for
        example,
        images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share), we retain all rights
        to our
        content (but not yours).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can only use our intellectual property and trademarks or similar marks with our express prior written
        permission.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You must obtain written permission from us or under an open source license to modify, create derivative works of,
        decompile, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Content Removal and Disabling or Terminating Your Account</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>We can remove any content or information you share on the Service if we believe that it violates these Terms of
        Use, our
        policies (including our <span style="background-color: #ffff01;">Community Guidelines</span>), or we are permitted or required to do so by law. We can refuse to
        provide
        or stop providing all or part of the Service to you immediately to protect our community or services, or if you
        create
        risk or legal exposure for us, violate these Terms of Use or our policies (including our <span style="background-color: #ffff01;">Community Guidelines</span>), if
        you
        repeatedly infringe other people's intellectual property rights, or where we are permitted or required to do so by
        law.
        We can also terminate or change the Service, remove or block content or information shared on our Service, or stop
        providing all or part of the Service if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate
        adverse
        legal or regulatory impacts on us. If you believe your account has been terminated in error, or you want to
        disable or
        permanently delete your account, consult our <span style="background-color: #ffff01;">Help Center.</span> <span style="background-color: #ffff01;">When you request to delete content or your account, the
        deletion process will automatically begin no more than 30 days after your request. It may take up to 90 days to
        delete
        content after the deletion process begins. While the deletion process for such content is being undertaken, the
        content
        is no longer visible to other users, but remains subject to these Terms of Use and our Data Policy. After the
        content is
        deleted, it may take us up to another 90 days to remove it from backups and disaster recovery systems.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the account deletion or content deletion process beginning in the
        following situations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in
            which case
            this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted); or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we
            will
            complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>where deletion would restrict our ability to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to
                identify or
                investigate misuse of our products or systems);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>protect the safety and security of our products, systems, and users;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement, or a government agency;
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has
            been
            retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If you delete or we disable your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but
        this
        section and the section below called "Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree" will still apply even after
        your
        account is terminated, disabled, or deleted.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Our Agreement and What Happens if We Disagree</h4>
  <h4>Our Agreement.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>If any aspect of this agreement is unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Any amendment or waiver to our agreement must be in writing and signed by us. If we fail to enforce any aspect of
        this
        agreement, it will not be a waiver.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Who Has Rights Under this Agreement.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Our past, present, and future affiliates and agents can invoke our rights under this agreement in the event they
        become
        involved in a dispute. Otherwise, this agreement does not give rights to any third parties.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You cannot transfer your rights or obligations under this agreement without our consent.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Our rights and obligations can be assigned to others. For example, this could occur if our ownership changes (as
        in a
        merger, acquisition, or sale of assets) or by law.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Who Is Responsible if Something Happens.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Our Service is provided "as is," and we can't guarantee it will be safe and secure or will work perfectly all the
        time.
        TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ALSO DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>We also don’t control what people and others do or say, and we aren’t responsible for their (or your) actions or
        conduct
        (whether online or offline) or content (including infringing, unlawful, or objectionable content). We also aren’t
        responsible for services and features offered by other people or companies, even if you access them through our
        Service.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Our responsibility for anything that happens on the Service (also called "liability") is limited as much as the
        law will
        allow. If there is an issue with our Service, we can't know what all the possible impacts might be. You agree that
        we
        won't be responsible ("liable") for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special,
        indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, even if we know
        they are
        possible. This includes when we delete your content, information, or account. Our aggregate liability arising out
        of or
        relating to these Terms will not exceed the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You agree to defend (at our request), indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities,
        damages,
        losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any
        way
        connected with these Terms or your use of the Service. You will cooperate as required by us in the defense of any
        claim.
        We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you,
        and
        you will not in any event settle any claim without our prior written consent.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How We Will Handle Disputes.</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Except as provided below, <strong>you and we agree that any cause of action, legal claim, or dispute between you
          and us arising
          out of or related to these Terms or Sit With Me ("claim(s)") must be resolved by arbitration on an individual
          basis.
          Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted;</strong> you and we may bring a claim only on your own
        behalf and cannot
        seek relief that would affect other users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular claim
        (or a
        request for particular relief) cannot be arbitrated in accordance with this provision's limitations, then only
        that
        claim (or only that request for relief) may be brought in court. All other claims (or requests for relief) remain
        subject to this provision.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You and we expressly waive a trial by jury.</strong></p>
      <p>The following claims don't have to be arbitrated and may be brought in court: disputes related to intellectual
        property
        (like copyrights and trademarks), violations of our Platform Policy, or efforts to interfere with the Service or
        engage
        with the Service in unauthorized ways (for example, automated ways). In addition, issues relating to the scope and
        enforceability of the arbitration provision are for a court to decide.</p>
      <p>This arbitration provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
      <p>You can opt out of this provision within 30 days of the date that you agreed to these Terms. To opt out, you must
        send
        your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your account, and a clear
        statement
        that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement, and you must send them here: Holy Grail LLC, C/O MBCB
        Attorneys,
        155 E Market Street, suite 400, Indianapolis, IN 46204.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Before you commence arbitration of a claim, you must provide us with a written Notice of Dispute that includes
        your
        name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your account, a detailed description
        of the
        dispute, and the relief you seek. Any Notice of Dispute you send to us should be mailed to Holy Grail LLC, C/O
        MBCB
        Attorneys, 155 E Market Street, suite 400, Indianapolis, IN 46204. Before we commence arbitration, we will send
        you a
        Notice of Dispute to the email address you use with your account, or other appropriate means. If we are unable to
        resolve a dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is received, you or we may commence
        arbitration.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The costs and fees of arbitration shall be allocated in accordance with the arbitration provider's rules,
        including
        rules regarding frivolous or improper claims.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For any claim that is not arbitrated or resolved in small claims court, you agree that it will be resolved
        exclusively
        in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana or a state court located in Marion County,
        Indiana. You
        also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such
        claim.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The laws of the State of Indiana, to the extent not preempted by or inconsistent with federal law, will govern
        these
        Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>
    </li>
