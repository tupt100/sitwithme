  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 17px; margin-bottom: 30px;">Got a question? We’re here to answer! If you don’t see your question here, drop us a line on our <a href="mailto:Support@Sitwithmeapp.com">Contact Page.</a></p>

  <h4>WHAT IS SIT WITH ME?</h4>
  <p>Sit With Me is an iOS application that allows service industry workers to connect with the patrons of these services.</p>

  <h4>WHO IS THE APP FOR?</h4>
  <p>The app is built for service industry workers to utilize as a tool to improve their individual customer base. The app
  also serves as a portal for customers to view information regarding the staff members they “sit with” while also being
  able to explore new venues and profiles in a desired area.</p>

  <h4>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO “SIT WITH” SOMEONE?</h4>
  <p>This should serve a similar purpose as to following someone on Instagram or connecting with someone on LinkedIn. This is
  the term for a staff member and a patron connecting via the app.</p>

  <h4>WHAT VALUE DOES IT BRING SERVERS?</h4>
  <p>We believe that the app provides the tools for servers to start better influencing who their customers are. Working in
  the service industry, the majority of the take home pay typically comes from tips, yet there isn’t enough influence on
  who is tipping you. Sit With Me changes that by giving more power and influence to a server.</p>

  <h4>WHAT VALUE DOES IT BRING CUSTOMERS?</h4>
  <p>Customers that are interested in a particular type of service will be able to connect with servers who provide that!
  After having a positive experience with a server, connecting with them will allow you to know the next time you are
  going in if they would be available. This will also allow customs to receive information regarding the server, if they
  moved restaurants or offering a special. Additionally, the app provides an explore option that aids in finding something
  new wether you are searching via venues or server profiles.</p>

  <h4>WHAT IF I DON’T WANT THIS INFORMATION PUBLIC?</h4>
  <p>Users will have the option of making their profile private. This means people will only be able to “sit with you” if you
  have granted them access to your account and only those who have this access can view the information you share.</p>

  <h4>IS THIS SAFE?</h4>
  <p>We find that using Sit With Me may be the safest option for people to professionally connect in this space. Using the
  app as your channel to connect, it can keep customers away from some personal information you may be sharing on various
  social media platforms or a more direct line like your phone number. We believe servers should be able to have more
  influence on the customers they serve without jeprodisring their safety and we will continue to develop an app that
  serves that purpose.</p>

  the “Privacy” tab. You now will see a toggle option next to “Account Privacy.” Switching the toggle to the right, making
  it green, makes your account private.</p>

  you like to do?” prompt. Tap “Block."</p>

  user. Reports are monitored and could result in an account being banned from the platform.</p>
